      <p>Hello! My name is Rebecca Schleimer. I'm from San Diego, California, and I have three siblings. Currently I am a rising senior at the University of Pennsylvania studying Economics and Chinese. 
        In the future I hope to enter a career in international business, data analytics, or consulting. Particularly interesting to me is consulting and or analytics within the realm of health care and or pharmaceuticals.
        Both of my parents are doctors, so I also have an interest in health care and patient care. I think the intersection between business and health care is a really interesting phenomenon that I would like to explore and cultivate in my 
        future career. I am currently taking a UCSD extension course in Web Development, because I strongly believe that it will help me in my future job hunt as well as distinguish me from other candidates. I believe it would also be a strength
        in the field of data analytics.</p>

      <p>In my free time, I really enjoy cooking and baking. I often cook for my family when I am at home! It's quite funny because while I'm away at school, they actually get takeout most of the time.
        I'm a much bigger fan of baking, however, because I find it calming and, well, delicious! I also love seeing the look on people's faces after I've baked (or cooked) something that turns out well. I also love to exercise, 
        hangout with my best friends Libby, Emma, and Vikki, and watch Netflix.</p>
